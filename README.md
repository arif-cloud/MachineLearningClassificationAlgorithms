# MachineLearningClassificationAlgorithms

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are robust and effective machine learning algorithms that transform your data into a linear decision space. The algorithm then determines the optimal hyperplane in this linear decision space, which separates your training data into different classes, such as legitimate or spam email.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  The K-nearest neighbors algorithm is one of the most basic classification algorithms. It compares each example of a particular class to all examples of that class by proximity. It's easy to implement because we can just take the mean of each class, which is easy to calculate. KNN can also be used to solve classification problems with multiple classes, since it's not sensitive to the number of attributes that can be used.

## Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are a subset of linear classifiers where the assumption is that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature. This means that we can use Bayesâ€™ theorem to calculate the probability of a particular label given our data by just looking at each feature individually, without considering how features may interact with each other.
